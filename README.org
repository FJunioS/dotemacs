#+TITLE: Junio Emacs config

This is my personal config based on several materials that I've encountered and
applied. After writing several similar "dotemacs", in this take I'll apply
concepts and to make this set of customization reproduceble and easy to read,
being some of those concepts:

- Use of Layers instead of modules
- Config in .el instead of parsing .org
- base structure directory named `core/' instead of `lisp/'
- Avoid use of CLIs or scripts by making instead use of
  Emacs powerful customization system
- Custom keymap system powered by `evil.el', inspired by
  Xah Lee's `xah-fly-keys.el'
