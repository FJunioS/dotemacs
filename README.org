#+TITLE: Junio Emacs config

This is my personal config based on several materials that I've encountered and
applied. After writing several similar "/Dotemacs/", in this take I'll apply
concepts and to make this set of customization reproducible and easy to read,
being some of those concepts:

- Use of Layers instead of modules
- Config in =.el= instead of parsing =.org=
- Base structure directory named =core/= instead of =lisp/=
- Avoid use of CLIs or scripts by making instead use of
  Emacs powerful customization system
- Custom keymaps system powered by =evil.el=, inspired by
  Xah Lee's =xah-fly-keys.el=
